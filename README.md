### Building from Source (Using Visual Studio 2017):

* Clone the Github repo
* Go into the folder for the project you want to build
* Navigate to the solution file for the project
* Open the solution file using Visual Studio 2017
* Ensure that you have [SDL2 2.0.8 VC](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) installed and correctly configured with Visual Studio. (Follow [this tutorial](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/windows/msvsnet2010u/index.php) to configure the project correctly)
	* Repeat the above tutorial for [SDL_TTF](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/release/SDL2_ttf-devel-2.0.14-VC.zip), [SDL_Image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/release/SDL2_image-devel-2.0.3-VC.zip) and [SDL_Mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/release/SDL2_mixer-devel-2.0.2-VC.zip)
	* Note that the links provided are for Visual Studio (VC++)
* Run the project (either in Debug or Release Mode). If you run into issues, confirm that you are building the project as a 32-bit project (x86)
